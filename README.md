üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
This project was a deep dive into modern Android development practices, showcasing a professional and scalable setup.

UI: 100% Kotlin with Jetpack Compose & Material 3.

Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with a clean, repository-pattern architecture.

Dependency Injection: Hilt for managing dependencies across the app.

Asynchronous Programming: Kotlin Coroutines & Flow for a fully reactive UI and efficient background tasks.

Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore for real-time data, and Storage for user-uploaded content).

Local Storage: Room Database for structured data and Jetpack DataStore for simple key-value preferences.

Testing: A robust suite of unit tests using JUnit, Mockito, and the Turbine library to ensure logical correctness and reliability.

Image Loading: Coil for efficient and simple image loading.

Animations: A rich set of animations built with Compose's animation APIs and the Konfetti library for delightful user feedback.

üöÄ Getting Started
To build and run this project yourself, you will need to set up your own Firebase backend.

Prerequisites
Android Studio (latest stable version)

A Google account for Firebase

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/Vnj91/AuraTrackr.git](https://github.com/Vnj91/AuraTrackr.git)

Create a Firebase Project

Go to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions.

Register Your App

Inside your new Firebase project, add a new Android app.

The package name must be com.example.auratrackr.

You can skip the SHA-1 key for now.

Download Your Configuration File

After registering the app, Firebase will prompt you to download a google-services.json file.

Download this file and place it in the app/ directory of the project (E:\AuraTrackr\app\google-services.json).

(Note: The .gitignore file in this project is correctly configured to prevent this file from being uploaded to GitHub, keeping your keys secure.)

Enable Firebase Services

In the Firebase Console, go to the Authentication section and enable the "Email/Password" and "Anonymous" sign-in methods.

Go to the Firestore Database section, create a database, and start in "Test mode" for now.

Go to the Storage section, create a storage bucket, and update the security rules to allow reads and writes for authenticated users (a simple rule like allow read, write: if request.auth != null; is a good start).

Build and Run

Open the project in Android Studio.

Let Gradle sync the project.

Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

This project has been a challenging but incredibly rewarding journey. Thank you for following along. I hope you enjoy exploring the code!
